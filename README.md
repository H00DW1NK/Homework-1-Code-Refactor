# Homework-1-Code-Refactor
First class homework assignment refactoring the given HTML and CSS to consolidate classes and follow the Scout Rule. 

Intitials Thoughts:
My thought process going into this homework is to etch out categorical classes for the function of this site and to add in proper information via comments.

In process obsercations:
1. Elongated phrases and words used as classes, need to consolidate.
2. No need for duplicative instances of id and classes for the same containers, this is fuel for confusion. Must choose path and cut uneeded attributes.
3. Adding a ';' to the end of CSS blocks STOPS the css from firing. 

After Action Review:
By combining the ids that had the same styling paramters I am abke to shorten the CSS list and make it more easily digestible and more easily navigabble should someone need to parse a container out and make changes.

Doing work in waves of combing classes first, then deleting classes and implementing id selectors, then renaming the ids was a better work method then doing one off changes. I must code in waves to boost effeciency.
